"""Conference worker — graceful placeholder.

Real conference intelligence (speaker/talk listings) needs a specific source or API. Until one is
configured this returns an empty *successful* result rather than fabricating data — so the pipeline treats
it as "nothing found here", not a failure. Wire a real source (e.g. a conf API / scraper) inside the body.
